We have three main classes: BloodDonor, BloodReceiver, and BloodBank.

The BloodDonor class represents a blood donor and stores information such as their name, blood group, age, and hepatitis status.
The BloodReceiver class represents a blood receiver and stores information such as their name, blood group, and age.
The BloodBank class is responsible for managing donors, receivers, and blood inventory.
The BloodBank class has various methods:

addDonor and addReceiver methods are used to add new donors and receivers to the blood bank.
loadDonorsFromFile and loadReceiversFromFile methods load donor and receiver data from text files, respectively. The data should be stored in a specific format (e.g., name, blood group, age).
saveDonorsToFile and saveReceiversToFile methods save donor and receiver data to text files, respectively.
adjustInventory method is used to update the blood inventory. It takes a blood group and the amount of change (e.g., +1 for donation, -1 for usage) and adjusts the inventory accordingly.
The BloodBankManagementSystem class is the main entry point for the program.

It creates an instance of the BloodBank class.
It calls the loadDonorsFromFile and loadReceiversFromFile methods to load donor and receiver data from files.
It performs other operations on the blood bank if needed.
Finally, it calls the saveDonorsToFile and saveReceiversToFile methods to save the updated donor and receiver data back to the files.
Overall, this code allows you to manage a blood bank by adding donors and receivers, loading and saving data from files, and updating the blood inventory based on donations and usages.
